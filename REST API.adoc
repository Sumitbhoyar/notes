**REST** stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is a web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol for data communication. It revolves around resources where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods. 

Web services based on REST Architecture are known as **RESTful Web Services**.  

REpresentational State Transfer indicates transfer of Resources across network.

URI should follow **hierarchical** structure: http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/{leagueId}/teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}

**Pagination url**: GET /users?pageSize=25&pageStartIndex=50

**Record filtering**: GET /users?role=admin

**Sort**: ?sort=created,modified 

**Response codes:**

- GET: 200 + Body

- POST: 200 + Body OR 201 Created + Body OR 204 No Content

- PUT: 200 + Body OR 201 Created + Body OR 204 No Content

**Hypermedia** is the engine of application state.

Hypermedia == HATEOAS

An **ETag** (entity tag) is an HTTP response header returned by an HTTP/1.1 compliant web
server used to determine change in content at a given URL.
ETags represents a version number of entity. 

ETags are used for two things â€“ caching and conditional requests.

GET Flow: Client request a resource. Server responds entity with ETag="SomeId". Client will send another request with If-None-Match="SomeId"
If the Resource is not modified yet then server just return 302, else it returns the entity with new ETag.

PUT flow: ETag matches then it updates else it return 412- Precondition fails indicating to load the resource again for update.

**Partial Items:** It allows to load only part of te resource.

It is useful to save the bandwidth. 

api/games/123/fields=id,name,url

Partial items works also for updating resource too, called patch.

**Versioning options**

**URI path** :  api/v2/user

**URI Parameter**: api/user?v=1.5

**Content Negotiation**: api/user

**ContentType**:application/api.1.param+json
