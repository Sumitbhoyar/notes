**REST** stands for REpresentational State Transfer. REST is a web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol for data communication. It revolves around resources where every component is a resource and a resource is accessed by a common interface using HTTP standard methods. 

Web services based on REST Architecture are known as **RESTful Web Services**.  

REpresentational State Transfer indicates transfer of Resources across network.

URI should follow **hierarchical** structure: ```http://api.soccer.restapi.org/leagues/{leagueId}/teams/{teamId}/players/{playerId}```

**Pagination url**: ```GET /users?pageSize=25&pageStartIndex=50```

**Record filtering**: ```GET /users?role=admin```

**Sort**: ```?sort=created,modified ```

**Response codes:**
- GET: 200 + Body
- POST: 200 + Body OR 201 Created + Body OR 204 No Content
- PUT: 200 + Body OR 201 Created + Body OR 204 No Content
- DELETE: 200 + Body OR 204 No Content OR 202 Accepted(Asynchronous)

**Hypermedia** is the engine of application state.

Hypermedia are links for other API

Helps to self describe API

Hypermedia == HATEOAS -  Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State

```javascript
{  
  "links": [{
    "href": "https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/sale/36C38912MN9658832",
    "rel": "self",
    "method": "GET"
  }, {
    "href": "https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/sale/36C38912MN9658832/refund",
    "rel": "refund",
    "method": "POST"
  }, {
    "href": "https://api.paypal.com/v1/payments/payment/PAY-5YK922393D847794YKER7MUI",
    "rel": "parent_payment",
    "method": "GET"
  }]
}
```

An **ETag** (entity tag) is an HTTP response header returned by an HTTP/1.1 compliant web
server used to determine change in content at a given URL.
ETags represents a version number of entity. 

ETags are used for two things – caching and conditional requests.

GET Flow: Client request a resource. Server responds entity with ETag="SomeId". Client will send another request with If-None-Match="SomeId"
If the Resource is not modified yet then server just return 302, else it returns the entity with new ETag.

PUT flow: ETag matches then it updates else it return 412- Precondition fails indicating to load the resource again for update.

**Partial Items:** It allows to load only part of te resource.

It is useful to save the bandwidth. 

```api/games/123/fields=id,name,url```

Partial items works also for updating resource too, called patch.

**Versioning options**

**URI path** :  ```api/v2/user```

**URI Parameter**: ``````api/user?v=1.5```

**Content Negotiation**: ```api/user```

**ContentType**:```application/api.1.param+json`````````

**RequestHeader**: ``````x-ms-version: 2011-08-10```


**HTTP Response codes**

- 1xx: Informational Communicates transfer protocol-level information.

- 2xx: Success Indicates that the client’s request was accepted successfully.

- 3xx: Redirection Indicates that the client must take some additional action in order to complete their request.

- 4xx: Client Error This category of error status codes points the finger at clients.

- 5xx: Server Error The server takes responsibility for these error status codes.


**HTTP response success code**

- 200 OK: Indicates a nonspecific success

- 201 Created: Sent primarily by collections and stores but sometimes also by controllers, to
indicate that a new resource has been created

- 202 Accepted: Sent by controllers to indicate the start of an asynchronous action

- 204 No Content: Indicates that the body has been intentionally left blank

- 301 Moved Permanently: Indicates that a new permanent URI has been assigned to the client’s requested
resource

- 303 See Other: Sent by controllers to return results that it considers optional

- 304 Not Modified: Sent to preserve bandwidth (with conditional GET)

- 307 Temporary Redirect: Indicates that a temporary URI has been assigned to the client’s requested
resource

**HTTP response error code**


- 400 Bad Request Indicates a nonspecific client error

- 401 Unauthorized Sent when the client either provided invalid credentials or forgot to send them

- 402 Forbidden Sent to deny access to a protected resource

- 404 Not Found Sent when the client tried to interact with a URI that the REST API could not
map to a resource

- 405 Method Not Allowed Sent when the client tried to interact using an unsupported HTTP method

- 406 Not Acceptable Sent when the client tried to request data in an unsupported media type format

- 409 Conflict Indicates that the client attempted to violate resource state

- 412 Precondition Failed Tells the client that one of its preconditions was not met

- 415 Unsupported Media Type Sent when the client submitted data in an unsupported media type format

- 500 Internal Server Error Tells the client that the API is having problems of its own
