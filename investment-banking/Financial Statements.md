# Financial Statements

Financial statements are written records that convey the business activities and the financial performance of a company. Financial statements are often audited by government agencies, accountants, firms, etc. to ensure accuracy and for tax, financing, or investing purposes. 

Financial statements include:

-   Balance sheet
-   Income statement
-   Cash flow statement

## Balance Sheet
-   A balance sheet is a financial statement that reports a company's assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity.
-   The balance sheet is one of the three (income statement and statement of cash flows being the other two) core financial statements used to evaluate a business.
-   The balance sheet is a snapshot, representing the state of a company's finances (what it owns and owes) as of the date of publication.
-   Fundamental analysts use balance sheets, in conjunction with other financial statements, to calculate financial ratios.

### Formula Used for a Balance Sheet

The balance sheet adheres to the following accounting equation, where assets on one side, and liabilities plus shareholders' equity on the other, balance out:

Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity 

This formula is intuitive: a company has to pay for all the things it owns (assets) by either borrowing money (taking on liabilities) or taking it from investors (issuing shareholders' equity).

For example, if a company takes out a five-year, $4,000 loan from a bank, its assets (specifically, the cash account) will increase by $4,000. Its liabilities (specifically, the long-term debt account) will also increase by $4,000, balancing the two sides of the equation. If the company takes $8,000 from investors, its assets will increase by that amount, as will its shareholders' equity. All revenues the company generates in excess of its expenses will go into the shareholders' equity account. These revenues will be balanced on the assets side, appearing as cash, investments, inventory, or some other asset.

## Income Statement

-   An income statement is one of the three (along with balance sheet and statement of cash flows) major financial statements that reports a company's financial performance over a specific accounting period.
-   Net Income = (Total Revenue + Gains) – (Total Expenses + Losses)
-   Total revenue is the sum of both operating and non-operating revenues while total expenses include those incurred by primary and secondary activities.
-   Revenues are not receipts. Revenue is earned and reported on the income statement. Receipts (cash received or paid out) are not.
-   An income statement provides valuable insights into a company’s operations, the efficiency of its management, under-performing sectors and its performance relative to industry peers.

### Income Statement Structure

Mathematically, the Net Income is calculated based on the following:

> Net Income = (Revenue + Gains) – (Expenses + Losses)

To understand the above details with some real numbers, let’s assume that a fictitious sports merchandise business, which additionally provides training, is reporting its income statement for the most recent quarter.

## Uses of Income Statements

Though the main purpose of an income statement is to convey details of profitability and business activities of the company to the stakeholders, it also provides detailed insights into the company’s internals for comparison across different businesses and sectors.

Based on income statements, management can make decisions like expanding to new geographies, pushing sales, increasing production capacity, increased utilization or outright sale of assets, or shutting down a department or product line.

Creditors may find limited use of income statements as they are more concerned about a company’s future cash flows, instead of its past profitability.

# Cash Flow Statement

-   A cash flow statement provides data regarding all cash inflows a company receives from its ongoing operations and external investment sources.
-   The cash flow statement includes cash made by the business through operations, investment, and financing—the sum of which is called net cash flow.
-   The first section of the cash flow statement is cash flow from operations, which includes transactions from all operational business activities.
-   Cash flow from investment is the second section of the cash flow statement, and is the result of investment gains and losses.
-   Cash flow from financing is the final section, which provides an overview of cash used from debt and equity.

# Profit and Loss Statement (P&L)
-   The P&L statement is a financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs, and expenses incurred during a specified period.
-   The P&L statement is one of three financial statements every public company issues quarterly and annually, along with the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.
-   It is important to compare P&L statements from different accounting periods, as the changes in revenues, operating costs, R&D spending, and net earnings over time are more meaningful than the numbers themselves.
-   Together with the balance sheet and cash flow statement, the P&L statement provides an in-depth look at a company's financial performance.

### What is a profit and loss (P&L) statement?

A P&L statement is one of the three types of financial statements prepared by companies, the other two being the  balance sheet, cash flow statement. The purpose of the P&L statement is to show the revenues and expenditures of the company over a specified period of time, usually one fiscal year.

Using this information, investors and analysts can assess the profitability of the company, often combining this information with insights from the other two financial statements. For instance, an investor might calculate a company’s  return on equity (ROE)  by comparing its  net income  (as shown on the P&L) to its level of  shareholder’s equity (as shown on the balance sheet).

### What is the difference between a P&L statement and a balance sheet?

Whereas the P&L shows the income, expenditures, and profitability of a company over a period of time, the balance sheet provides a snapshot of the company’s assets and liabilities as of a certain date. Typically, the balance sheet is presented as of the last day of the company’s fiscal year. Investors use the balance sheet to understand the financial strength of the company, comparing the amount and quality of its assets against its liabilities.

## Why Are P&L Statements Published?

P&L statements are published for a variety of reasons. The inner financial workings of a company are of great interest to numerous people, including accountants, economists, and investors. Because certain companies are so large, even the business owners themselves may not have a comprehensive understanding of all the company's financial movements without consulting the P&L. For all of these professionals, assessing a company's financial strength means taking a detailed look at total revenue, the amount of debt or  leverage, additional investments, secondary operations, and tax burden.

These statements help businesses establish current performance relative to projections and create forecasts for the future. They also compare performance to other companies in the same industry and identify unnecessary expenditures or areas for improvement.
