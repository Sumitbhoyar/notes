### Transaction Date

A transaction date is a date upon which a trade takes place for a  security or other financial instrument. The transaction date represents the time at which ownership officially transfers. In banking, the date a transaction appears in the account is also referred to as the transaction date, although it is not necessarily the date on which the bank clears the transaction and deposits or withdraws funds.

**Example:-**

To better understand the trading process and the trade date, consider the following example. An investor buys 10 shares of a stock from their brokerage trading platform on Tuesday, December 5, 2019, during standard market trading hours. The investorâ€™s purchase initiates the trade and receives a trade date of December 5, 2019.

The processing time for settlement of most listed stocks is two days so the buyer would officially receive the shares of stock in their trading account in T+2 which equates to a settlement date of Thursday, December 7, 2019.

### Settlement Date

The settlement date is the date when a trade is final, and the buyer must make payment to the seller while the seller delivers the assets to the buyer. The settlement date for stocks and bonds is usually two  business days  after the execution date (T+2). For government securities and options, it's the next business day (T+1). In spot foreign exchange (FX), the date is two business days after the transaction date. Options contracts and other derivatives also have settlement dates for trades in addition to a contract's  expiration dates.

### Trade Date vs. Settlement Date

The trade date is one of two important dates involved in a transaction. The trade date records and initiates the transaction. The settlement date is the next step in the transaction. The settlement date usually differs from the trade date. The settlement date is the date on which the transfer between two parties is executed. It is worth noting that actual legal ownership is transferred on the settlement date, not the trade date.

The amount of time that passes between the trade date and the settlement date differs depending on the trading instrument and is known as the settlement period. The settlement timeframe is noted as T+ the number of days to settlement. Some instruments, like certificates of deposit (CDs), have settlement dates that are the same as the trade date. Mutual funds may settle one day after the trade date. In September 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted T+2 settlement for most securities. T+2 settlement pertains to stocks, bonds, municipal securities, exchange-traded funds, certain mutual funds, and limited partnerships that trade on an exchange.

### What Is a Transaction Date

A transaction date is a date upon which a trade takes place for a  security or other financial instrument. The transaction date represents the time at which ownership officially transfers. In banking, the date a transaction appears in the account is also referred to as the transaction date, although it is not necessarily the date on which the bank clears the transaction and deposits or withdraws funds.

### Transaction Date vs. Settlement Date

As financial transactions have multiple steps, they have multiple dates that mark the process.  Clearing is the full process of a transaction, from the moment parties commit to a transaction through settlement. The transaction date is not necessarily the same date as the settlement date, which can happen several days after the transaction occurs. The seller is paid upon settlement, because all of the details about the transaction have been finalized, and because the buyer is certain that what has been promised has actually been delivered.

Regular way transactions settle on the second business day after the trade date, which is referred to as T+2. Most securities, including stocks and corporate bonds, settle this way. However, U.S. government securities have a regular way settlement of T+1. With some transactions, it is possible to specify a desire to settle on the same day as the trade. These are referred to as cash trades.

### T+1, T+2, and T+3
-   In order to clear the transfer of a security from a seller to a buyer, it must go through a settlement process, which creates a delay between the time a trade is made ('T') and when it settles.
-   Historically, a stock trade could take as many as five business days(T+5) to settle a trade.
-   Today, with the advances in technology and electronic trading, most stock trades settle in just two business days (T+2).

T+1 (T+2, T+3) abbreviations refer to the settlement date of security transactions. The T stands for transaction date, which is the day the transaction takes place. The numbers 1, 2 or 3 denote how many days after the transaction date the settlement or the transfer of money and security ownership takes place.

**Example:-**

As an example of how T+1 (T+2, T+3) settlement dates work, consider an investor who buys shares of Microsoft [MSFT] on Monday, April 9, 2018. While the broker would debit the investor's account for the total cost of the investment immediately after the order is filled, the investor's status as a shareholder of Microsoft will not be settled in the company's record books until Wednesday, April 11. The settlement date is the date on which the investor become a shareholder of record. Weekends and public holidays are not included in the day count.
