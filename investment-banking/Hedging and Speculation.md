# Hedging and Speculation

Futures contract are mainly used by hedgers, speculators, and arbitrators, which plays a pivotal role in the market. In this context, people often juxtapose the terms hedging and speculation as they are in the way connected with the unanticipated price movements, but they are different in a number of grounds.  **Hedging**  is performed by the hedgers to protect themselves against the risk or say to reduce the risk of the changes in the price of the underlying commodity.

On the contrary, speculators perform  **speculation**, in an attempt to earn profit from the changes in the difference between future price and spot price, as they bet on their difference. Hence, the risk is taken intentionally to reap profits.

### Hedging

By the term hedging, we mean a technique of managing price risk. It is used to minimize or eliminate the probability of substantial loss or profits due to movements in the price of the underlying asset (i.e. A commodity or financial instrument), suffered by an investor. This is possible only by holding contrary positions in two different markets to counterbalance the risk of loss. Therefore, if there is a loss/gain in the cash position because of the price fluctuations, it can be offset by the movements in the prices of a futures position.

### Definition of Speculation

The term speculation refers to the process of buying and selling of an asset incorporating considerable risk, in the hope of generating good returns from an anticipated change in the price level.

In an attempt to make huge profits, speculators look for an opportunity where they can take advantage of fluctuations in the price of the financial asset. The asset can be stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives and other tradable items. They do not trade in any investments randomly rather they take calculated and analyzed risk. The risk may result in bearing the loss of initial outlay in a futures contract or it may turn into rewards.  

## Key Differences Between Hedging and Speculation

The difference between hedging and speculation can be drawn clearly on following grounds:

1.  Hedging is the act of preventing an investment against unforeseen price changes. The process in which the speculators trade in an underlying asset of the high-risk element, in order to earn profits, is known as speculation.
2.  Hedging is a means to control or eliminate risk. Conversely, speculation depends on risk, in the hope of making good returns.
3.  Hedging offers protection against undesired price fluctuations. On the other hand, Speculation involves incurring risk to generate profits from price changes.
4.  Hedgers are risk averse, who secure their investment through hedging. Speculators are risk lovers, who take risks deliberately and play a critical role in providing liquidity in the market.
