# Forward Contracts vs. Futures Contracts

Forward and  futures contracts are similar in many ways: both involve the agreement to buy and sell assets at a future date and both have prices that are derived from some underlying asset. A forward contract, though, is an arrangement made over-the-counter (OTC) between two counterparties that negotiate and arrive on the exact terms of the contractâ€”such as its expiration date, how many units of the underlying asset are represented in the contract, and what exactly the underlying asset to be delivered is, among other factors. Forwards settle just once at the end of the contract. Futures, on the other hand, are standardized contracts with fixed maturity dates and uniform underlyings. These are traded on exchanges and settled on a daily basis.

### Forward Contract

A forward contract is a private agreement between the buyer and seller to exchange the underlying asset for cash at a particular date in the future and at a certain price. On the settlement date, the contract is settled by physical delivery of asset in consideration for cash. Settlement date, quality, quantity, rate and the asset are fixed in the forward contract. Such contracts are traded in a decentralized market, i.e. Over the counter (OTC) where the terms of the contract can be customized as per the needs of the parties concerned.

The buyer in a forward contract is considered as long, and his position is assumed as long position while the seller is called short, holds a short position. When the price of the underlying asset rises and is more than the agreed price, the buyer makes a profit. But if the prices fall, and is less than the contracted price the seller makes a profit.

### Definition of Futures Contract

A binding contract which is executed at a later date is a future contract. It is an exchange-traded contract of the standardized nature where two parties, decides to exchange an asset, at an agreed price and future specified a date for delivery and payment. A future contract is a standardized in terms of the quantity, date, and delivery of the item. The buyer holds long position while the seller holds a short position in this contract.

As the contracts are traded in the official exchange, which acts as both mediator and facilitator between the buyer and seller. The exchange has made it mandatory for both the parties to pay an upfront cost as a margin.

The unique feature of the future contract is marking to a market where the prices are subject to fluctuations. Hence, the differences in the price of contracts are settled daily. Further, the futures are divided into two broad categories, which are:

-   Commodity Futures: The contract whose subject matter is commodities such as aluminum, gold, coffee, sugar etc.
-   Financial futures: The contract which deals with financial instruments like treasury bill, currency and so on.

## Key Differences Between Forward and Futures Contract

The basic differences between forward and futures contract are mentioned below:

1.  An agreement between parties to buy and sell the underlying asset at a certain price on a future date is a forward contract. A future contract is a binding contract whereby the parties agree to buy and sell the asset at a fixed price and a future specified date.
2.  The terms of a forward contract are negotiated between buyer and seller. Hence it is customizable. Conversely, a futures contract is a standardized one where the conditions relating to quantity, date, and delivery are standardized.
3.  Forward contracts are traded Over the Counter (OTC), i.e. there is no secondary market for such contracts. On the other hand, a Futures contract is traded on an organized securities exchange.
4.  When it comes to settlement, forward contracts settle on a maturity date. As compared to the future contract which is marked to market on a daily basis, i.e. the profit or losses are settled daily.
5.  There is a high counterparty risk in case of forward contract as compared to a futures contract.
6.  In the case of a forward contract, there are high chances of default by a party, as the agreement is private in nature. Unlike a future contract, where clearing houses are involved, that guarantees the transaction, so the possibility of default is almost nil.
7.  If we talk about the size of the contract, in a forward contract, it depends on the terms of the contract, whereas the size is fixed in case of the futures contract.
8.  The maturity of the contract is as per the contractual terms in the forward contract while the same is predetermined in the futures contract.
9.  In forward contracts, there is no requirement of collateral, but in futures contracts, initial margin is required.
10.  Forward contracts are self-regulated. Unlike futures contracts, which are regulated by the securities exchange.
