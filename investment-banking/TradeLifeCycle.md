# Trade life cycle

Trade is a process of buying and selling any financial instrument.
Just like any other product even trade has its life cycle involving several steps.

The Trade Life Cycle is the referred to, as the workflow of a trade order from its inception stage until the Settlement of the Trade, The Trade Life cycle can be categorized into Front Office, Middle Office and Back Office activities

### Front Office: 
The Front office is usually referred very commonly as the trading floor; it mainly performs two main functions, which 1) Trade Capture and 2) Trade Execution. The front office is where the trade gets initiated.

- Trade Execution

Execution refers to filling a buy or sell order in the market, subject to conditions placed on the order by the end client.
It invovles inputting all trade details in the official book of record system, linking all reference data, and calculating profit and loss.
There are several ways to execute a trade and they encompass manual as well as automated methods.
Brokers are required by law to find the best possible means to execute a client's trade.

- Trade Capture

The trade capture system validates all the necessary trade information and assigns a trade confirmation number or a trade reference number; this number will be unique and will be used for all subsequent trade events like amendment, cancellation etc; This reference number is sent back to both the parties (seller and buyer) as an acknowledgement of the “booking” confirmation.

### Middle Office:
The Middle Office in Trade Life Cycle plays a very vital role in the exception management. This is where the three important steps are done, which are 1) Validation, 2) Booking and 3) Confirmation.

Using an Order Management System (OMS), the trader works on the deal, using the OMS the trade gets enriched by static data like the standard settlement instructions (SSI) of the counterparty, Custodian details, City holidays, special instructions etc etc.

This static data details are important and critical for the completion and settlement of the trade. The allocation of the trade is done in the middle office (Allocation by Lot Size) and finally the trade gets transmitted into the Back Office, this is when the trade is considered to live and active.


### Back Office:
 The Back Office is technically the “back bone” of the entire life cycle of the trade. The Back Office primarily performs three important functions which are 1) Clearing, 2) Settlement and 3) Accounting. This stage deals with significant operational activities such as record keeping, order confirmations, trade settlement and regulatory reporting.

In most cases, the back office activities are usually outsourced to cheaper sources for its respective management activities (for example .. outsourced to companies like Reuters, Capco, Bloomberg etc.), in order to cut down costs for the company which increases their profitability by delivering greater operational value

## The following ten steps make up the entire lifecycle of a trade.

An investor (either an individual who invests for themselves, known as a ‘retail investor’, or an institution, an organisation investing on behalf of their clients such as a fund) scopes out some tasty potential investment opportunities. Once they’ve made a decision to make a move and buy a particular security, such as shares in a company, the process kicks off…

### Stage one: the order

The investor informs the broker firm and their custodian (a financial institution – usually a bank – which looks after their assets for safekeeping) of the security they would like to buy, and at what price – either the market price or lower. This is called a buy order.

(A couple more jargon nuggets for you here: A market order is an order to buy or sell at the market prices. A limit order is an order to buy or sell at a client’s specified price, or higher.)

### Stage two: front office action

The investor’s order is received by the front office sales traders at the brokerage firm. From this point, the order is fed down to the risk management experts in the middle office of the organisation. The sales traders then ‘execute’ the order…

### Stage three: risk management

The risk management team will conduct a number of checks and calculations to see whether the levels of risk involved with the client’s order mean it’s still safe to accept and proceed to the next stages. Amongst other things they will check the client placing the order has sufficient stocks to pay for the security and the limits.

### Stage four: off to the exchange

When an order is accepted and validated by the risk management team, the broker firm sends it to the Stock Exchange…

Now, let’s pause for a breather and consider what’s going on the sell-side of things, i.e. the guys with the security to sell. They will also put in a sell order to their broker, stating the security they have to make available on the market and the market price (how much they want to sell it for).

The sell order goes through all of the necessary risk management procedures in the middle office on this side as well. All being well, it then shoots off to the exchange too…

### Stage five: match making

Now it’s time for match making at the exchange. It’s a bit like the awkward Singles’ Night of trading. The exchange has to find the match between a security’s buy order and sell order. Once the beautiful moment of a perfect match happens…

### Stage six: trade made

A trade is born! Then, quick as a flash, we’re into post trade territory. The exchange sends information on the trade back to the brokers for confirmation, and also details of the trade to the investor’s custodian. The brokers’ front office sales team can then inform their clients of the trade.

### Stage seven: confirmation

In order to proceed further, confirmation is necessary. The broker on each side of the trade has checked that their client agrees with details and conditions: details such as which security is being traded, how much it’s being traded for and the settlement date.

The exchange will also send these details to the custodian who will relay this information to the broker for confirmation.

Once the trade has been confirmed by the brokers and as long as each party agrees with the details and conditions, the back office team gets to work, and the clearing house comes into play…

### Stage eight: clearing begins

The clearing house will make all of the necessary calculations for the buy side and the sell side of the trade in order to determine what’s needed from each of them and by when. It’s their job to make sure all of the obligations are fulfilled. They inform each party of what’s needed.

Trades are referred to generally as T+1, T+2 and T+3. ‘T’ refers to the transaction date (the date on which the trade was made). +1, +2 or +3 refers to the settlement date. If a trade is marked T+2 for example, securities and cash will be exchanged two days after the trade is made. On the settlement date the sell side must have transferred their security and the buy side must have transferred the money for their purchase.

The majority of settlements are now T+2. The UK and Irish capital markets will move to a T+2 settlement period from October 2014.

### Stage nine: settlement

Finally, the glorious settlement date arrives: the transfer of money and the security. Back office staff are responsible for ensuring that these payments are made on time and documented and reported in the correct manner.

The transfer isn’t done directly between the trading parties: the clearing house will have accounts for each side of the trade and will facilitate the transfer. The buy side will transfer cash for the security via the clearing house, and likewise the sell side will hand over their security. Then everyone’s happy!

At the end of each trade day the clearing house will provide reports on settled trades to exchanges and custodians.

# The Clearinghouse:
A clearinghouse is a designated intermediary between a buyer and seller in a financial market. The clearinghouse validates and finalizes the transaction, ensuring that both the buyer and the seller honor their contractual obligations.


Every financial market has a designated clearinghouse or an internal clearing division to handle this function.


The responsibilities of a clearinghouse include "clearing" or finalizing trades, settling trading accounts, collecting margin payments, regulating delivery of the assets to their new owners, and reporting trading data.

Clearinghouses act as third parties for futures and options contracts, as buyers to every clearing member seller, and as sellers to every clearing member buyer.

The clearinghouse enters the picture after a buyer and a seller execute a trade. Its role is to accomplish the steps that finalize, and therefore validate, the transaction. In acting as a middleman, the clearinghouse provides the security and efficiency that is integral to stability in a financial market.

In order to act efficiently, a clearinghouse takes the opposite position of each trade, which greatly reduces the cost and risk of settling multiple transactions among multiple parties. While their mandate is to reduce risk, the fact that they have to act as both buyer and seller at the inception of a trade means that they are subject to default risk from both parties. To mitigate this, clearinghouses impose margin requirements.

The futures market is highly dependent on the clearinghouse since its financial products are leveraged. That is, they typically involve borrowing in order to invest, a process that requires a stable intermediary.

Each exchange has its own clearinghouse. All members of an exchange are required to clear their trades through the clearinghouse at the end of each trading session and to deposit with the clearinghouse a sum of money, based on the clearing house's margin requirements, that is sufficient to cover the member's debit balance.
