## Asset Management

Asset management is the direction of all or part of a client's portfolio by a financial services institution, usually an investment bank, or an individual. Institutions offer investment services along with a wide range of traditional and alternative product offerings that might not be available to the average investor.

Asset management refers to the management of investments on behalf of others. The process essentially has a dual mandate - appreciation of a client's assets over time while mitigating risk.

Asset management is a service offered by financial institutions catering to high net-worth individuals, government entities, corporations and financial intermediaries.

The role of an asset manager consists of determining what investments to make, or avoid, that will grow a client's portfolio. Rigorous research is conducted utilizing both macro and micro analytical tools. This includes statistical analysis of the prevailing market trends, interviews with company officials, and anything else that would aid in achieving the stated goal of client asset appreciation. Most commonly, the advisor will invest in products such as equity, fixed income, real estate, commodities, alternative investments and mutual funds.

### Example of an Asset Management Institution
Merrill Lynch offers a Cash Management Account (CMA) to fulfil the needs of clients who wish to pursue banking and investment options with one vehicle, under one roof. The account gives investors access to a personal financial advisor. This advisor offers advice and a range of investment options that include initial public offerings (IPO) in which Merrill Lynch may participate, as well as foreign currency transactions.

## Financial Advisor
A financial advisor provides financial advice or guidance to customers for compensation.
As a financial advisor to large institutional investors, an investment bank may provide strategic advice on a variety of financial matters.

A financial advisor is a professional who provides expertise for clients' decisions around money matters, personal finances, and investments.
Financial advisors may work as an independent agent or they may be employed by a larger financial firm.

They accomplish this mission by combining a thorough understanding of their clients' objectives, industry, and global markets with the strategic vision necessary to spot and evaluate short and long-term opportunities and challenges.
