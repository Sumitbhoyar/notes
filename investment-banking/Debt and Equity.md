# Debt and Equity

Capital is the basic requirement of every business organization, to fulfill the long term and short term financial needs. To raise capital, an enterpirse either used owned sources or borrowed ones. Owned capital can be in the form of **equity**, whereas borrowed capital refers to the company’s owed funds or say **debt**.

### Debt

Money raised by the company in the form of borrowed capital is known as Debt. It represents that the company owes money towards another person or entity. They are the cheapest source of finance as their cost of capital is lower than the cost of equity and preference shares. Funds raised through debt financing are to be repaid after the expiry of the specific term.

Debt can be in the form of term loans, debentures or bonds. Term loans are obtained from financial institutions or banks while debentures and bonds are issued to the general public. Credit Rating is mandatory for issuing debentures publicly. They carry fixed interest, which requires timely payments. The interest is tax deductible in nature, so, the benefit of tax is also available. However, the presence of debt in the capital structure of the company can lead to financial leverage.

Debt can be secured or unsecured. Secured Debt requires pledging of an asset as security so that if the money is not paid back within a reasonable time, the lender can forfeit the asset and recover the money. In the case of unsecured debt, there is no obligation to pledge an asset for getting the funds.

### Equity

In finance, Equity refers to the Net Worth of the company. It is the source of permanent capital. It is the owner’s funds which are divided into some shares. By investing in equity, an investor gets an equal portion of ownership in the company, in which he has invested his money. The investment in equity costs higher than investing in debt.

Equity comprises of ordinary shares, preference shares, and reserve & surplus. The dividend is to be paid to the equity holders as a return on their investment. The dividend on ordinary shares (equity shares) is neither fixed nor periodic whereas preference shares enjoy fixed returns on their investment, but they are also irregular in nature. Although the dividend is not tax deductible in nature.

Investment in equity shares is the risky one as in the event of winding up of the company; they will be paid at the end after the debt of all the other stakeholders is discharged. There are no committed payments in equity shareholders i.e. the payment of dividend is voluntary. Apart from that, equity shareholders will be paid off only at the time of liquidation while the preference shares are redeemed after a specific period.
