# Bonds

A bond is a type of loan. When a company needs funds for any number of reasons, they may issue a bond to finance that loan. Much like a home mortgage, they ask for a certain amount of money for a fixed period of time. When that time is up, the company repays the bond in full. During that time the company pays the investor a set amount of interest, called the coupon, on set dates.

#### Face Value

A bond's face value is the amount the issuer provides to the bondholder, once maturity is reached.

The actual market value of a stock or a bond is not reliably indicated by its face value, because there are many other influencing forces at play, such as supply and demand, often governed by the dollar figure at which investors are willing to buy and sell a particular security, at a specific point in time. In fact, depending on market conditions, the face value and market value may have very little correlation.

#### What is the difference between face value and a bond’s price?

A bond’s face value is fixed, often issued in $1,000 denominations. By contrast, its’ price fluctuates in response to market interest rates, time to maturity, and the issuer’s credit rating. A bond may be priced above par, or below par based on these conditions. For example, if interest rates increase, bond prices will decline, trading at a discount to face value in the secondary market.

Bonds are generally priced at a face value (also called par) of $1,000 per bond, but once the bond hits the open market, the asking price can be priced lower than the face value, called a discount, or higher than the face value, called premium.2﻿ If a bond is priced at a premium, the investor will receive a lower coupon yield, because they paid more for the bond. If it's priced at a discount, the investor will receive a higher coupon yield, because they paid less than the face value.

#### Maturity

This is the date when the principal or par amount of the bond is paid to investors and the company's bond obligation ends. Therefore, it defines the lifetime of the bond.

#### Coupon

The  coupon amount represents interest paid to bondholders, normally annually or semiannually. The coupon is also called the coupon rate or nominal yield. To calculate the coupon rate, divide the annual payments by the face value of the bond.

## Risks of Bonds
##### Interest Rate Risk

Interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds, so when rates rise, bonds tend to fall and vice versa. Interest rate risk comes when rates change significantly from what the investor expected.

##### Credit/Default Risk

Credit or default risk is the risk that interest and principal payments due on the obligation will not be made as required. When an investor buys a bond, they expect that the issuer will make good on the interest and  principal payments—just like any other creditor.

##### Prepayment Risk

Prepayment risk is the risk that a given bond issue will be paid off earlier than expected

## Bond Yield
A bond's yield refers to the expected earnings generated and realized on a fixed-income investment over a particular period of time, expressed as a percentage or interest rate.

## Debenture?

A debenture is a type of bond or other debt instrument that is unsecured by collateral. Since debentures have no collateral backing, they must rely on the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer for support. Both corporations and governments frequently issue debentures to raise capital or funds.

## Key Players in the Bond Market
#### Bond Issuers

The issuers sell bonds or other debt instruments in the bond market to fund the operations of their organizations. This area of the market is mostly made up of governments, banks, and corporations.

The biggest of these issuers is the government, which uses the bond market to fund a country's operations, such as social programs and other necessary expenses.

#### Bond Underwriters

The underwriting segment of the bond market is traditionally made up of  investment banks and other financial institutions that help the issuer to sell the bonds in the market.

#### Bond Purchasers

The final players in the market are those who buy the debt that is being issued in the market.

## Zero-Coupon Bond
A zero-coupon bond, also known as an accrual bond, is a debt security that does not pay interest but instead trades at a deep discount, rendering a profit at maturity, when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.
