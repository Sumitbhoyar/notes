## Cloud Computing
Definition: The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

## SaaS  Vs  PaaS  Vs  IaaS
Common Examples of SaaS, PaaS, & IaaS
Platform Type	Common Examples
**SaaS**: Google Apps, Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting
**PaaS**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, OpenShift
**IaaS**	: DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE)

### SaaS: Software as a Service

Clients, in this case usually web browsers, provide the point of access to software running on servers.
Due to its web delivery model, SaaS eliminates the need to download and install applications on each individual computer;
SaaS provides numerous advantages to employees and companies by greatly reducing the time and money spent on tedious tasks such as installing, managing, and upgrading software. 

 - SaaS Characteristics

    Managed from a central location
    Hosted on a remote server
    Accessible over the internet
    Users not responsible for hardware or software updates

 - When to Use SaaS

    If you are a startup or small company that needs to launch e-commerce quickly and don’t have time for server issues or software
    For short-term projects that require collaboration
    If you use applications that aren’t in-demand very often, such as tax software
    For applications that need both web and mobile access

### PaaS: Platform as a Service

PaaS provides a framework for developers that they can build upon and use to create customized applications. All servers, storage, and networking can be managed by the enterprise or a third-party provider while the developers can maintain management of the applications.
The delivery model of PaaS is similar to SaaS, except instead of delivering the software over the internet, PaaS provides a platform for software creation. This platform is delivered over the web, and gives developers the freedom to concentrate on building the software while still not having to worry about operating systems, software updates, storage, or infrastructure.

 - PaaS Advantages

    Makes the development and deployment of apps simple and cost-effective
    Scalable
    Highly available
    Gives developers the ability to create customized apps without the headache of maintaining the software
    Greatly reduces the amount of coding
    Automates business policy
    Allows easy migration to the hybrid model


 - PaaS Characteristics

    It is built on virtualization technology, meaning resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes
    Provides a variety of services to assist with the development, testing, and deployment of apps
    Numerous users can access the same development application
    Web services and databases are integrated

### IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service

IaaS delivers Cloud Computing infrastructure to organizations, including things such as servers, network, operating systems, and storage, through virtualization technology. 

 - IaaS Advantages

    Is the most flexible cloud computing model
    Easily allows for automated deployment of storage, networking, servers, and processing power
    Hardware can be purchased based on consumption
    Gives clients complete control of their infrastructure
    Resources can be purchased as-needed
    Is highly scalable

 - IaaS Characteristics

    Resources are available as a service
    The cost varies depending on consumption
    Services are highly scalable
    Typically includes multiple users on a single piece of hardware
    Provides complete control of the infrastructure to organizations
    Dynamic and flexible
