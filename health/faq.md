# Health FAQ

## How much protein I need
1. https://examine.com/nutrition/protein-intake-calculator/
2. To maximize the benefit for building muscle, you’ll want to consume at least 160g or 0.8g/lb, whichever is greater. 


## Is it true that eating too much protein at once is a waste?
No. There is a limit on how fast your body can absorb protein. But, if you consume more than it can handle, the protein resides in your gut until its turn; you can eat more than 30g.

## Should I train full-body or a body-part split?
As a beginner, doing a body-part split is not taking advantage of your advanced recovery capabilities. Splits should be left to the more advanced strength trainees who need longer to recover.

## Can I lose fat and build muscle at the same time?
The ability to gain muscle while losing fat is dependent on the relationship between your fatness and muscularity. An overly-fat and under-trained person will be able to achieve simultaneous fat loss and muscle gain. A very lean person near his/her limit for muscle growth will not.  The vast majority of people will see better/quicker results by choosing to do one or the other (gain muscle, lose fat – often referred to as ‘bulking’ and ‘cutting’, respectively) at a time. 

## Is my metabolism super fast/really slow?
It’s probably not. Excluding rare and serious metabolic conditions, which should be diagnosed by a doctor, people’s metabolisms tend to be within 200-300 calories of each other.

## How important is nutrient or meal timing?
Contrary to mythos, there is not an “anabolic window” in which you have to chug a protein shake immediately after a workout. In truth, it’s total protein consumption throughout the day and generally getting enough protein within the several hours around your workout that matters.
For the best results and recovery from your training, you should always eat some protein and carbs within the window of a few hours before or after your workout – this can be before, after, or both.

## Should I always lift to failure?
Training to complete failure likely isn’t necessary to maximize growth – you can likely leave a couple reps in the tank.  Unfortunately, people aren’t very good at knowing how close to failure they actually are.  Taking a set to failure “idiot-proofs” it to make sure you maximized the stimulus.

## Does cardio impair muscle gains?
Doing cardio before resistance training had no apparent negative effect on hypertrophy, though it did negatively impact leg strength. Avoiding cardio can hold back your training.

## Am I not getting a good workout if I’m not sweating?
Sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation. When you get hot, sweating is a process your body uses to cool you down. Sweating has no bearing on the quality of your workout, nor is it a measure of how hard you are working. It is simply a reaction to excess body heat.

## I want to lift weights but not get huge. What should I do?
Putting on muscle is a very slow process and not at all easy. It takes many years of hard, dedicated, and consistent work. It is not possible to become huge and muscular by accident. Unless you’re specifically training and eating to “be huge” for a very long time, you’re not going to reach that point.

## I’m not sore after my workout. Did I do something wrong?
No. It is a common misconception that if you are not sore after a workout, then you didn’t work out hard enough.
Soreness (aka DOMS) is only a sign that your body did something new. It is not an indicator of anything other than novelty, especially the quality or intensity (or lack thereof) of your workout. As your body adapts to new demands, soreness will lessen and maybe even go away completely. Workout quality should be measured by things that can actually be measured and progressed.

## Does lifting weights stunt growth?
Nope.
Lifting weights with proper form while maintaining a healthy diet will not stunt your growth. In fact, weight lifting has many benefits for youths including increased strength for sports and higher self-esteem.
