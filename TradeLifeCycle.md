# Trade life cycle

Trade is a process of buying and selling any financial instrument.
Just like any other product even trade has its life cycle involving several steps.

The Trade Life Cycle is the referred to, as the workflow of a trade order from its inception stage until the Settlement of the Trade, The Trade Life cycle can be categorized into Front Office, Middle Office and Back Office activities

### Front Office: 
The Front office is usually referred very commonly as the trading floor; it mainly performs two main functions, which 1) Trade Capture and 2) Trade Execution. The front office is where the trade gets initiated.

Using the trade app (the front end user application) is where the order gets booked on the front office as per the market price of the instrument; however the buyer does an option to quote an offer to the selling counterparty. (There are several ways to place a trade order … like Market Order, Market on close (MOC), Limit Order, Stop Order etc) If the counterparty agrees to the details of the trade and is willing to enter into the deal, the trade then gets executed.

When the trade is executed, its gets captured in the trading desk (in the Front Office) usually using a Trade capture system. The trade capture system validates all the necessary trade information and assigns a trade confirmation number or a trade reference number; this number will be unique and will be used for all subsequent trade events like amendment, cancellation etc; This reference number is sent back to both the parties (seller and buyer) as an acknowledgement of the “booking” confirmation.

### Middle Office:
The Middle Office in Trade Life Cycle plays a very vital role in the exception management. This is where the three important steps are done, which are 1) Validation, 2) Booking and 3) Confirmation.

Using an Order Management System (OMS), the trader works on the deal, using the OMS the trade gets enriched by static data like the standard settlement instructions (SSI) of the counterparty, Custodian details, City holidays, special instructions etc etc.

This static data details are important and critical for the completion and settlement of the trade. The allocation of the trade is done in the middle office (Allocation by Lot Size) and finally the trade gets transmitted into the Back Office, this is when the trade is considered to live and active.


### Back Office:
 The Back Office is technically the “back bone” of the entire life cycle of the trade. The Back Office primarily performs three important functions which are 1) Clearing, 2) Settlement and 3) Accounting. This stage deals with significant operational activities such as record keeping, order confirmations, trade settlement and regulatory reporting.

In most cases, the back office activities are usually outsourced to cheaper sources for its respective management activities (for example .. outsourced to companies like Reuters, Capco, Bloomberg etc.), in order to cut down costs for the company which increases their profitability by delivering greater operational value

### The following ten steps make up the entire lifecycle of a trade.

1. The Order
The trade life cycle begins when the investor informs the firm that they wish to either buy or sell a particular instrument or product. The investor will include information on the product and the bid/ask price in this order.

2. The Front Office Action
The investor’s order is received by the front office traders at the firm. The order is then passed to risk management experts in the firm’s middle office.

3. Risk Management
The risk management team will check the order and estimate the level of risk. This process will determine whether or not it is safe to complete the proposed order.

4. The Execution Venue
Once the order has been accepted and validated by the risk management team, it will be sent to the relevant execution venue.

5. Matching the Orders
The execution venue then looks for a sell order which matches the buy order placed by the investor or, in the case of a sale, looks for a corresponding buy order.

6. Trade Completed
Once a matching order has been found, the trade is completed. Once this step has taken place, the post trade process begins. The firm’s front office team will now inform the investor that the trade has been completed.

7. Confirmation 
The brokers on each side of the trade will then confirm that their respective clients agree to the conditions set forth. These conditions include the price at which the instrument has been traded, the settlement date, and any number of other variable factors.

8. Reconciliation 
The reconciliation stage of the trade life cycle ensures that all accounts of the trade which has taken place are consistent and accurate. Reconciliation can be performed in a number of ways, but generally speaking it involves the act of comparing ledgers against statements from both sides of the trade. This sures up any records made and avoids the possibility of fraud or inaccurate record keeping.

9. Clearing
Once confirmation has taken place, the clearinghouse will make the necessary calculations to determine what is needed from the buy-side and sell-side respectively.

10. Settlement
Finally, the back-office staff will ensure that the relevant payments are made on time, that they are documented, and that they are reported correctly. Pending the completion of these three tasks, the trade life cycle is completed.

# The Clearinghouse:
A clearinghouse is a designated intermediary between a buyer and seller in a financial market. The clearinghouse validates and finalizes the transaction, ensuring that both the buyer and the seller honor their contractual obligations.


Every financial market has a designated clearinghouse or an internal clearing division to handle this function.


The responsibilities of a clearinghouse include "clearing" or finalizing trades, settling trading accounts, collecting margin payments, regulating delivery of the assets to their new owners, and reporting trading data.

Clearinghouses act as third parties for futures and options contracts, as buyers to every clearing member seller, and as sellers to every clearing member buyer.

The clearinghouse enters the picture after a buyer and a seller execute a trade. Its role is to accomplish the steps that finalize, and therefore validate, the transaction. In acting as a middleman, the clearinghouse provides the security and efficiency that is integral to stability in a financial market.

In order to act efficiently, a clearinghouse takes the opposite position of each trade, which greatly reduces the cost and risk of settling multiple transactions among multiple parties. While their mandate is to reduce risk, the fact that they have to act as both buyer and seller at the inception of a trade means that they are subject to default risk from both parties. To mitigate this, clearinghouses impose margin requirements.

The futures market is highly dependent on the clearinghouse since its financial products are leveraged. That is, they typically involve borrowing in order to invest, a process that requires a stable intermediary.

Each exchange has its own clearinghouse. All members of an exchange are required to clear their trades through the clearinghouse at the end of each trading session and to deposit with the clearinghouse a sum of money, based on the clearing house's margin requirements, that is sufficient to cover the member's debit balance.
