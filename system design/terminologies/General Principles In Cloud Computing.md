# General Principles In Cloud Computing

- Small And Focused Components Win

- We need to have small, focused pieces of components/teams. Work with small batches, change faster, lower complexity

e.g, single purpose containers are better than monolithic containers. Microservices wins over monolithic systems.

- Make Errors Apparent

e.g, For breaking API changes, how we can detect them automatically and quickly?

- Replace Documents By Code

e.g, No one enjoy reading lengthy documents. Even if they do, the rules/guidelines will be violated somehow. Enforce the logic by code.

- Avoid Routine Manual Tasks

e.g, Need to repetitively do something with no need of thinking? Take some time and automate them.

- Store No Secrets

The best way to keep a secret is donâ€™t know the secret.

e.g, Store secrets in db. Data on rest and data in transit
