# Head vs Tail recursion

## Recursion

In Java, the function-call mechanism supports the possibility of having a method call itself. This functionality is known as recursion.

There are two main requirements of a recursive function:

- A Stop Condition – the function returns a value when a certain condition is satisfied, without a further recursive call
- The Recursive Call – the function calls itself with an input which is a step closer to the stop condition

## Tail Recursion

A recursive function is tail recursive when recursive call is the last thing executed by the function.

    public int tailSum(int currentSum, int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return currentSum + n;
        }
        return tailSum(currentSum + n, n - 1);
    }

With tail recursion, the recursive call is the last thing the method does, so there is nothing left to execute within the current function.

## Head recursion

    public int sum(int n) {
        if (n >= 1) {
            return sum(n - 1) + n;
        }
        return n;
    }
