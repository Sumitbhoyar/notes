# Terminologies

- Worms: A worm is a malicious program that replicates itself in order to spread to other systems.
Worms can take the form of executable programs that a user is tricked into downloading and executing.

- Anti-Forgery Tokens:Anti-forgery tokens are typically (strongly) random numbers that are stored in a cookie or on the server as they are written out to the hidden field. The server will compare the token attached to the inbound request with the value stored in the cookie. If the values are identical, the server will accept the valid HTTP request.

- Same origin Policy: To prevent websites from tampering with each other, web browsers implement a security measure known as the same-origin policy. The same-origin policy lets resources (such as JavaScript) interact with resources from the same domain, but not with resources from a different domain. This provides security for the user by preventing abuse, such as running a script that reads the password field on a secure website.
